EAM to MAS Manage Migration Solution Accelerator
================================================

Finalize a MAS deployment option
--------------------------------
- MAS On-Prem
- MAS on Hyperscalers (Azure/AWS)
- MAS SaaS (Following steps won't apply)
- MAS Dedicated (Following steps won't apply)

Get an OCP cluster
------------------
- Use the product infra sizing sheet to determine the required infra size.
	- If not using DB2, the DB sizing needs to be done seperately.
- For Azure/AWS: Option available to use BYOL approach to setup OCP + MAS
- For other cloud vendors or on-prem setup:
	- Provision your VMs for master/worker nodes
	- Install OCP on the provisioned VMs
- Provison and add required storage classes to the cluster
- <Security/VPN steps to be added>

Pre-migration checks/steps in EAM
---------------------------------
- Ensure EAM version is upgraded to 7.6.1.2
- Ensure all OOB Object structures have no custom changes
- Take this opportunity to plan and remediate all JAVA customizations, and convert them into OOB configurations or automation scripts as much as possible.
- Take a backup of all custom XML files
- Take a backup of all custom RPTDESIGN files
- Take a backup of all custom java and class files
- Take a backup of all doclinks files and folders
- Anywhere and Work centers are not officially supported by IBM in MAS 8.10+

DB Migration Steps
------------------
- If not using CP4D, plan for DB sizing
- Provision the DB server, and install the required DB technology
	- Or provision the required DB service from the cloud of your choice
- Gather all necessary user credentials for the database
- Ensure all pre-migrations steps are covered
- Copy the PROD DB data from source server to the destination server/cluster (cloud/On-Prem)
	- If underlying DB change is planned, use Schema Conversion Tool to migrate DB
	- If using DB2 inside CP4D, then CP4D needs to be installed first (check MAS env setup steps)
- DB connectivity with MAS cluster
- Setup HADR for DB

Setup CP4D
----------
- Only applicable for MAS environments where MAS Monitor is planned or if Manage DB is planned to exist in CP4D
- Migrate Manage DB from source DB to CP4D
	- Use schema conversion tool if source DB is NOT DB2.

Setup MAS environment
---------------------
- Install MAS on Openshift
	- If the cluster is on Azure/AWS, option available to use BYOL templates to install MAS
	- Otherwise, use Ansible automation to install MAS Core and Manage
		- Provide the DB details while setting up Manage installation
		- Add required Industry solutions and add-ons as required post Manage installation.
	- Or, Install MAS Core using Ansible automation and proceed with Manage installation manually.

Post Migration steps in MAS
---------------------------
- Ensure all JVMs are configured and deployed in MAS
- Create a data archive of all Java Customizations using the appropriate folder path and import that in MAS Core using some cloud storage service
- Migrate all Integration endpoints, deploy all custom certificates, enable any VPN tunnel if required.
- Configure User integration for LDAP/SAML/SSO
- Ensure all groups have appropriate Security access, considering new sigoptions will be added in Manage
- Ensure all custom Manage configurations are in place, make any required changes
- Deploy the doclinks files and folders in the appropriate location
- Make any final changes as required
- Testing and debugging issues
